						<div id="date">August 31, 2014 14:44</div>
						</br>
						<p>I gained a lot of experience working at Red Hat, and most of those have to be summarized concisely into three-word phrases in order to fit on a one-page resume.  So I figured I'd write a blog post with the long version of those skills.</p>

						<h4>Worked on an Agile-style sprint team</h4>

						<p>What I was trying to convey with this line was the general teamwork I did, as well as my experience with Agile techniques.  My sprint team was made up of about ten people, and we were one of six teams on a larger "Application Infrastructure" team.  The AppInfra team ran itself on two-week sprint cycles beginning with a sprint planning meeting and ending with each sprint team demo-ing what they had accomplished that sprint</p>

						<p>This style of work allowed me to learn time management around focusing projects into two-week runs and public speaking when presenting my work to the entire team as a demo.  In addition, our smaller subteam met every day for a scrum video call to update the team on progress we'd made, what we planned to do today, and any blockers we had.  That allowed me to keep track on my projects in a daily to-do sense as well as be oriented into the larger picture of what our team was working on.</p>

						<h4>Wrote C code...</h4>

						<p>Honestly, the only C experience I had before this internship was writing code for Arduino.  I learned a ton that my high school C++ classes never covered, such as pointers, memory leaks, Valgring, debugging tools, Makefiles, and more.</p>

						<h4>...that intersects and builds off my coworkers' projects</h4>

						<p>This was based on an article I read once about preparing students for internships.  It said that one of the biggest culture-shocks for CS students in industry is that for school projects, they're used to writing their own code, creating an entire project from scratch.  It's been true for me.</p>

						<p>But in industry, that situation is uncommon.  You're reading code other people have written, and writing patches, or adding features that meld seamlessly with what already exists.  This takes skill and practice.  Reading and understanding other people's code takes different skills from composing your own.  In addition, it requires writing readable, well-commented patches that follow the existing coding guidelines.  My code at Red Hat was built off the code of my coworkers, and other coworkers based their projects off my code.  It all fits into a larger scheme, and knowing how to write code as a piece of a whole is crucial.</p>

						<h4>Made significant contributions to the open source community</h4>

						<p>This was pretty exciting for me, because Red Hat was my first experience with open source communities and the idea of "pushing code upstream" for review and acceptance.  But watching my patches get merged into the main project repository was a feeling I'll never forget.</p>
