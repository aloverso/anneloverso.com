			<h2>My Red Hat Summer Internship</h2>
			<h4>Or, the story of how I became an Open Source activist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>>  Summer 2014</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="span8">
					<p>In the summer of 2014, I worked as a Systems Management Intern at <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>.  My role was on <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io">Project Atomic</a>, a lightweight OS that performs atomic upgrades and rollbacks, designed to run Docker containers.  My summer work focued on OSTree and rpm-ostree, the programs that allow deploying a new version of your OS alongside the current one and navigating between them.  Specifically, I made these programs and their command-line interface easier to use by sysadmins.  For a more detailed description of my various projects, <a href="reveal/expo_pres.html">check out this short presentation.</a></p>

					<p>My experience at Red Hat was a wholly positive one.  I learned so much about open source culture, Linux development, C programming, and Unix navigation and tools.  Not only that, but my first corporate experience gave me a lot of insight into teamwork, scrum meetings, working to follow established coding guidelines, working within a larger project, and the support structure of a sprint team that you don't get as much exposure to in school.  Overall, it was a great experience, and you can read more about what it felt like to be working in the Red Hat environment in <a href="https://opensource.com/life/14/7/red-hat-intern-sys-admin">this article I wrote about my internship published on opensource.com</a></p>

			<h2>Building a 3D Scanner</h2>
			<h4>Six Weeks and $100 budget - why not?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>>  Spring 2014</h4>

				<div class="span8">
					<p>For a the final project for a first-year, second-semester sensors and measurements class, three other students and I worked together to build an infrared 3D scanner.  We were inspired by a lab we had done on ultrasonic range finders, and wanted to use that technology to make a device that could build a 3D image of an object.</p>

				 	<p>We used an Arduino to control an infrared sensor, which took data at each step to calculate the distance to the object. The data were processed in MATLAB, and we used the 3D plotting function to create a virtual image of the solid object. We then were able to take those data points and reconstruct them into a solid surface in SolidWorks, and 3D print the virtual scan of the object.</p>

					<p>Overall, the project was a lot of fun.  It was a great teamwork experience as well as a learning opportunity to gain more knowledge of circuits, MatLab, mechanical design, and data analysis.  Another teammate and I were proud enough of the project to present it at an adult science fair at <a href="http://artisansasylum.com">Artisan's Asylum</a> in Somerville, MA.</p>

			<h2>FrisbE: the Engineering Education App for Kids</h2>
			<h4>It stands for "Fostering Real Innovation in Students Beginning Engineering"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>>  Spring 2014</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="span8">
					<p>For the final project for my Python Software Design class, my team and I worked together to create an app that could teach kids in the age range of 8-11 about engineering in a fun, interactive way.  We created an app with four minigames that each focused on a separate engineering skill.  Unlike most apps on the market, which teach "science" or "physics", we wanted to focus on engineering concepts, so our four minigames taught:
					<ul>
						<li>Computational logic</li>
						<li>Critical thinking in the context of population dynamics</li>
						<li>Diagnosis in mechanical systems</li>
						<li>Creative exploration into materials science</li>
					</ul></p>

					<p>The project was a team effort, and each of us adopted a minigame to focus on.  I built the computational logic game ("Robowrangler"), which involved a player navigating a robot through an obstacle course by building a "script" of commands and watching as the robot responded to each command in real time.  The goal was to show that computers think differently from humans and need specific commands in order to navigate simple tasks.  It also had video-game components such as collecting money to buy power-ups for your robot.</p>

					<p>I do research two credits per semester on Engineering Education with Professor Yevgeniya Zastavker.  My interest in education, especially in engineering, has only been fueled by my time at Olin and my time on this research team.</p>

					<p>My team of four students has been working on researching what causes students to go into teaching careers later in life.  This is based off the statistic that Olin students are entering teaching careers at almost twice that national average.</p>
					
					<p>We collected survey data for a case study at Olin from over 200 current students and alumni, and spent the spring semester of 2014 analyzing that data.  We applied for an NSF Grant to conduct interviews with selected subjects, nad our research paper on that first round of data was accepted for the <a href="http://fie2014.org/">Frontiers in Education 2014 conference</a> in Madrid.  Overall, it's been an amazing, educational experience.</p>

I was on a subteam that would esnure the efficiency of the bike design by measuring the power output of each biker and the power loss due to friction and other sinks.</p>

					<p>With two other students, we acquired a $1700 treadmill free off Craigslist, deconstructed it in an apartment attic, and carried the pieces down a fire escape and back to school.  We planned to use the bike wheels to turn the rollers, generating a voltage in the treadmill motor.  We would then measure that voltage and convert it to a power output.  Sounds easy, but it involved numerous calculations, and building a voltage divider that would reduce the frankly dangerous voltage levels coming from the motor, which included buying an enormous ceramic resistor.  I learned a lot from this project on both mechanical structure as well as electrical circuit construction, and improved my skills in both areas.</p>

					<p>For a Modeling and Simulation class final project, my partner and I studied weather balloons rising into the atmosphere. Weather balloons are unique because they are made of flexible latex that can expand. We examined how the radius of the balloon expands with increasing altitude and decreasing air pressure, which affect the buoyancy and drag forces on the balloon. We then examined how the initial balloon radius affects how many balloons it takes to lift different load masses, and compared it to party balloons. We found that weather balloons, because of the changing radius, take far fewer balloons to lift the same mass.</p>

					<p>How does the color of the interior of a car affect the time it takes for a child left in the enclosed vehicle to suffer a heat-related death?</p>

					<p>Twenty states currently have laws which prohibit leaving children unattended in vehicles. Since 1998, 604 children have suffered heat-related deaths in cars. My partner and I examined the system of the enclosed vehicle. We abstracted the thermal flows into equations based on blackbody radiation and conduction, and implemented them in MATLAB. Our model demonstrated that the darker the dashboard color, the sooner the air temperature in the car reaches 50°C. However, the color of the dashboard is less important on hotter days.</p>

			<h2>Oscillating Electromagnets Circuit</h2>
			<h4>"At least the oscillations worked"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>>  Fall 2013</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="span8">
					<p>My partner and I intended to design and build a system that used electromagnets to keep a metal ball centered on an oscillating ramp. It used a hysteretic oscillator to tilt up and down a lego bar attached in the center to a motor. The intent was to place a metal ball in the track of this bar and, using electromagnets placed at either end of the bar, keep the ball centered desipite the motor's oscillations. The electromagnets would do this by turning on and off in opposition with the tilt of the bar. The circuitry ended up successful but the practicality of the magnets on the ramp prevented us from fully achieving our goal. It was a complex circuit design challenge to cause the electromagnets to oscillate in opposition, that we eventually solved using transistors.</p>
