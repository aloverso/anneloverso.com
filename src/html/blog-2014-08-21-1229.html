						<div id="date">August 21, 2014 12:29</div>
						</br>

						<p>I'm going to be honest here, my internship at Red Hat was my first true experience with writing code for Real People.  That is, people besides me, maybe my professor.  I'd never written code that would be distributed to the masses.  Programs that would be used by a significant number of people.</p>

						<p>There are a few things to adapt in your coding style when Writing For Many, especially if you have lax coding teachers who didn't enforce these habits when you were learning:</p>

						<h4>Internationalization</h4>

						<p>I mentioned this briefly in my previous article, but you have to remember that your code output will be translated into multiple languages.  Write in a way that will preserve that meaning across language boundaries and synactical differences.  That means no code along the lines of:

						<pre><code>printf ("%s has %s point%s of karma", user, points, points > 1 ? "s" : "");</code></pre>

						which makes a lot of sense, but not every language uses an "s" to pluralize. No good.</p>

						<h4>Readability</h4>

						<p>This is another item that is always talked about in coding classes but not all too often enforced.  Make your code readable.  Use indents correctly.  COMMENT YOUR CODE.  Name your variables sane things and not just "thing1" and "x".  Make your commit messages more informative than "update".  When it's just written for you and your professor, you both know what that function is supposed to do.  When someone in Europe is trying to add a feature two years from now, it won't be so clear to them.</p>

						<h4>Worst-Use-Case Scenarios: Don't Cut Corners</h4>

						<p>Recently, I was working on a feature to name deployments in OSTree.  One piece of this was making sure they user-defined custom name was unique and not already assigned to another deployment, and listed in a key-value file.</p>

						<p>Obviously, my first notion was to cycle through the key-value pairs and check if the values match.  But loops are expensive.  Could I do it another way?</p>

						<p>So I thought for a bit.  What if I converted the contents of the key-value file to a string, using a simple library-defined command, and then used a string utility function to check if the proposed name was contained in this long string of the whole file.</p>

						<p>This was a bad idea, I quickly realized.  If the proposed new name was "e", and you had another deployment named "red", it would register as non-unique.  No good at all.  Obviously, in the target use case, you'd be naming your deployments "v1.0-stable" or "wip-no-metalinks" and the functionality would be correct.  But users don't behave like your target use cases.  So you have to plan for every use case, and just go with the loop.</p>

						<p>Besides, when you think about it, converting to a string is probably uses a loop anyways.</p>
