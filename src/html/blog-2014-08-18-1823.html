						<div id="date">August 18, 2014 18:23</div>
						</br>
						<p>I think about this situation a lot, because it's a great allegory to real life and how we're all definitely going to do if the world ever does reach some kind of mass apocalypse.</p>

						<h4>The background:</h4> 
						<p>At Red Hat, we have these fabulous well-stocked break rooms full of coffee, drinks, snacks, and more.  One snack supplied is a basket full of tiny Hershey's chocolate bars, which as the reader may know, come in variety packs of Mr. Goodbars, Krackels, Milk Chocolate, and Special Dark.</p>

						<h4>The situation:</h4>
						<p>As I quickly observed within my first week or so on the job, software engineers are picky.  They are picky in what text editors they like to use.  They are picky in coding standards.  And they are picky in chocolate tastes.  I mean that last one literally, because software engineers at Red Hat like to pick the Special Darks out of the mixed baskets.  So much so that finding a single Special Dark bar in the basket is an incredible rarity, like finding a unicorn in the parking lot instead of your car after a particularly long day, or writing some code with no bugs.</p>

						<h4>The economic avalanche:</h4>
						<p>When I first came to Red Hat, I was a casual Special Dark user.I enjoyed it occaisionally, nibbling while mulling over code.  But, after I had first made the realization that Special Darks were rare and precious, my behavior changed.  If I saw a Special Dark in the basket, I grabbed it immediately, even if I hadn't been in the mood for one.  I was practically a slightly-saner Gollum, caressing my Special Dark bar and whispering "my precious."</p>

						<p>But that's not even the worst of it.  On occasion, I would find myself in the breakroom right after it had been restocked.  Right after the Special Darks had been restored to 25% of the basket population.  So what did I do?  I considered the options.  Special Darks were a rare commodity.  I could take one or two, even though I wasn't there looking for them.  But, when I did want some, they would almost certainly be gone when I came back.  So I did what any reasonable person would do under the circumstances.  I took almost all of them and hid them in a drawer in my cube.  Yes, you heard me.  I hoarded the Special Darks.  I created my own stash, a dragon hoard of my own brand of gold.  Now I had them whenever I wanted.</p>

						<p>I like to think that I'm not a bad person, I'm just the product of the situation.  The Red Hat Special Dark Shortage is a self-perpetuating problem.  Because I noticed other people taking the Special Darks, I was forced to amp up my hoarding game in order to get any.  Because of me, more people were affected by the shortage I caused and the problem continues.</p>

						<p>I'd be a terrible citizen in a real apocalypse.  A meteor crashes into the Earth, things are looking dire, the President is advising everyone stay calm and wait for them to distribute even rations, and I'll be at the supermarket stocking up on canned vegetables and bottled water.  Because if something's rare, I'm galvanized into every-person-for-themself mode.</p>

						<p>The way to solve th chocolate bar problem?  I don't know.  If they stocked more, I would just take more.  Only a full market saturation, of so many Special Darks that demand could not possibly exceed supply, would stopper that behavior.  That, or waiting until my co-workers have given up on Special Darks to the extent that they are no longer so in-demand.</p>

						<p>If you read that last sentence again in the context of an apocalypse, I'm suggesting we hoard until enough people die of starvation that it's no longer necessary.</p>

						<p>Economics are crazy, man.</p>
