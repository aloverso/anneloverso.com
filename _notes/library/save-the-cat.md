### [Joyful Militancy: Building Thriving Resistance in Toxic Times](https://www.akpress.org/joyful-militancy.html) by Nick Montgomery and carla bergman
" | markdownify }}

<div class="text-sm mtm">
Why do radical movements and spaces sometimes feel laden with fear, anxiety, suspicion, self-righteousness, and competition? Montgomery and bergman call this phenomenon rigid radicalism: congealed and toxic ways of relating that have seeped into social movements, posing as the “correct” way of being radical. In conversation with organizers and intellectuals from a wide variety of political currents, the authors explore how rigid radicalism smuggles itself into radical spaces, and how it is being undone.

## Notes

**Finished:** Jan 2021

**Rating (out of 5):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Would absolutely recommend this book to anyone steeped in any activist circles or with a history of organizing. It takes a firm stance against the status quo, both in the world, and in the groups organizing against it. It identifies the currents that pull people away from increasing *joy* in the Spinozan sense (ie, positive affect, and empowerment to grow and live fully).
