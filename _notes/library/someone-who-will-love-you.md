Written with all the scathing dark humor that is a hallmark of BoJack Horseman, Raphael Bob-Waksberg delivers a fabulously off-beat collection of short stories about love—the best and worst thing in the universe.

Featuring:

- A young engaged couple forced to deal with interfering relatives dictating the appropriate number of ritual goat sacrifices for their wedding.
- A pair of lonely commuters who ride the subway in silence, forever, eternally failing to make that longed-for contact.
- A struggling employee at a theme park of U.S. presidents who discovers that love can’t be genetically modified.
- And fifteen more tales of humor, romance, whimsy, cultural commentary, and crushing emotional vulnerability.

## Notes

**Finished:** Feb 2021

**Rating (out of 5):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

I really enjoyed the writing style here. Some of the stories were hit-or-miss. I don't give out 5-stars lightly but this was really poignant.

- Favorite story was *Move Across the Country* for its poignant and depressing take on the Sadness that follows you
- Liked all of the honestly spot-on New York City references. *The Serial Monogamist's Guide to New York City Landmarks* really drove this one home in a great way. New York is such a spatially-oriented city.
