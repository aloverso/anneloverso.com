A finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in Nonfiction, Nicholas Carr's bestseller The Shallows has become a foundational book in one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the internet's bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? This 10th-anniversary edition includes a new afterword that brings the story, "a Silent Spring for the literary mind" (Slate), up to date, with a deep examination of the cognitive and behavioral effects of smartphones and social media.
