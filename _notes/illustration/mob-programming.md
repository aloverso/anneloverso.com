### Say this is you, and you’re trying to decide what to get for lunch.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/02-hotdog.jpg" alt="with a hot-dog" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### It’s pretty easy. You weigh the pros and cons — what you ate recently, what’s nearby, how hungry you’re feeling — and you make a decision.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/03-solo-decision.jpg" alt="a group of people" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### But now, you have to decide where to go for lunch for you and your five coworkers.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/04-solo-restrictions.jpg" alt="group with food restrictions" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Each one of them has a preference or dietary restriction that you need to take into account.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/05-solo-map-options.jpg" alt="map with restaurant options marked" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### And you have to balance that with whatever restaurants you’re aware of and can recommend.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/06-solo-extra-constraints.jpg" alt="group with unspoken food preferences" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### And of course, each of your friends has other opinions and context, which will affect their response to the lunch choice, that you’re not even privy to!
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/07-cant-eat-this.jpg" alt="disgusted by a plate of lobster" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### With all these factors at play, the most likely outcome is someone sitting at a table unhappily wondering "how the heck did we wind up here?"
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/08-paired-decision.jpg" alt="2 people deciding for a group" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### One possible option is to pair on the decision — with two of you making the call for the group, it should be easier to make a tough decision, right?
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/09-paired-map-options.jpg" alt="map with restaurant options marked" class="illustration" />
    <div class="caption">
<div markdown="1">

### With two of you, it’s easier to combine your restaurant knowledge to expose more options, and better prioritize and remove inadequate options.
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/10-paired-extra-contraints.jpg" alt="group with unspoken food preferences" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### But even so, there’s still four people with unknown preferences and contexts at play.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/11-cant-eat-this.jpg" alt="disgusted by a plate of lobster" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### And it’s still possible (or even likely!) to wind up with someone unhappy with the result.
### What to do? Is there a solution?
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/12-mob-decision.jpg" alt="whole group deciding" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Well... what if everyone was responsible for making the decision together?
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/13-mob-talking.jpg" alt="whole group talking over each other" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### You may say to me: "Anne, that’s crazy. That would just devolve into looking like this."
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/14-mob-arguing.jpg" alt="whole group yelling at each other" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Or it would look like this.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/15-mob-whatever.jpg" alt="whole group apathetic" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Or, maybe worst of all, it would look like this.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/16-mob-map-options.jpg" alt="map with restaurant options marked" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### But... just imagine with me, for a moment, what the benefits would be.

Collectively, the group could pool all their combined knowledge of great lunch spots — and also quickly rule them out when someone shares a concern.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/17-mob-drinks.jpg" alt="group getting drinks together" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### And because everyone is sharing their context and is involved in the decision-making process, it’s highly unlikely to wind up with someone thinking “how did we wind up here?”
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/18-two-reasons.jpg" alt="more perspectives shared and everyone knows how we got here" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### This leads us to the following two concrete benefits of collective decision-making.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/19-conference-room.jpg" alt="devs in a conference room mob coding" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### What if we applied the same principle to writing code?
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/20-doubtful-stakeholder.jpg" alt="doubtful stakeholder" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Maybe you say to me: "Anne, that’s ridiculous. That’s paying 6 people to do one person’s job."
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/21-whiteboarding.jpg" alt="devs whiteboarding solutions collaboratively" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Maybe that’s true... if you define an engineer's job as hands-on-keyboard code-input time.
But I think I get paid to solve problems. The written code is just a byproduct detail of that. What matters is decision-making, evaluating tradeoffs, and ideating solutions.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/22-pair-teaching.jpg" alt="pair teaching" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Another benefit of mob programming — it helps level up your less-experienced engineers into mentors.
In a pair, the more-experienced engineer tends to do the teaching.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/23-mob-teaching.jpg" alt="mob teaching" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### But in a mob, that less-experienced person can turn around and be the mentor to a new person.
And they still have the experienced engineer on hand to help with tricky issues, as needed.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/24-democracy.jpg" alt="claiming pure democracy does not work" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Maybe you say to me: "Anne, this sounds nice and all, but pure democracy can’t work in practice!"
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/25-chaos.jpg" alt="group in chaos" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### "It will just devolve into chaos! Or autocracy!"
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/26-rotation.jpg" alt="driver rotation technique" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Luckily, much like democracy, there are techniques we can use to facilitate order.
### For example, have only 1 or 2 keyboards, and rotate drivers on a timer to distribute responsibility.
I recommend you keep keyboards stationary and get people to physically move seats!
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/27-eyes-on-you.jpg" alt="all eyes on you while coding" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Maybe you say to me: "Anne, that sounds terrifying, especially for newer engineers. Being expected to code with your whole team watching you? Yikes!"
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/28-backseat-driving.jpg" alt="backseat driving" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Luckily, there are techniques for this too.
"Backseat driving" is a technique where the mob collectively decides what to do and how, and the driver is responsible only for inputting the decisions as code.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/29-mob-drinks.jpg" alt="team celebrating with drinks" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Mobbing can be an effective way to make impactful decisions on a team.
### It gives everyone a chance input, facilitates learning, and leaves no one wondering “how did the code wind up here?”
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/30-kindess.jpg" alt="kindess, reflection, listening" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### There are lots of techniques out there to help your mobbing be as successful as possible.
### The best way for the group to succeed is to remember:
Be kind. Listen. And most importantly, reflect on what worked, and keep iterating on your mob techniques for the future!
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
    <img src="/assets/images/mob-programming/31-happy-mob.jpg" alt="happy mob" class="illustration" />
    <div markdown="1" class="caption">

### Don’t be afraid to try it out!
### You don’t need to mob program 100% of the time. Start by mobbing when you come to a key decision in the code.
Or, when you’re implementing a brand new pattern, and want everyone to be on the same page about it. Or when doing a big refactor, and more people’s context facilitates better decisions.
