Today I learned (or, re-learned) about the [Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion){% Foot num:"1" %}, which of course means I am destined to re-hear about it at least once a week for the next month.

> the **Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon** (aka *frequency illusion*) is when a concept or thing you just found out about suddenly seems to crop up everywhere.

## When it's a bad thing

There's a corollary between the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon and confirmation bias. You see things because you're primed to see things. Drawing conclusions here can be dangerous.

A common example is: I've just learned about the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon. Maybe I then start noticing people talking about it on Twitter and in my book club. I might draw the conclusion that this is a trending topic, and that the volume of conversation has in fact increased.{% Foot num:"2" %}

This conclusion is likely incorrect - I am making it just because I notice the phrase more than I did before.

This can then lead to "perhaps people are talking about it more *because* I wrote about it" and drawing assumptions and conclusions from these connections.

## When it's a good thing

Being subconsciously "on the lookout" for connections to a concept or term you just learned can help you draw together different things in different domains.

This is, arguably, exactly the point of a [[digital garden]]! By seeing your works as a work-in-progress, it encourages connections between topics you're thinking about. Dense linking between notes is a representation of Baader-Meinhof in action, because it represents your mind drawing connections between things just because you wrote notes about them.

The [power of densely-linked notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC) is a way of self-triggering the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.

## Using it to your advantage

Much like the [Three-Strike Rule for Blogging](https://www.swyx.io/three-strikes/), noticing when the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is playing out can help you see links in things you didn't see before.

Yesterday I was talking about karma and dice-rolling systems in [[tabletop RPGs]]. Today I was having a conversation about the theory of insurance and collective risk-management. When I hear things about luck in insurance theory, the frequency illusion in my brain triggers, connecting it back to discussing luck in RPGs. Boom! That's a connection thread I didn't see before. Now I have a new angle for discussing RPGs - from an insurance risk-management perspective. Maybe I'll hear about luck systems again in a few days now that I'm primed to notice it. Seems ripe for a blog post now.{% Foot num:"3" %}

        If you're wondering why this is named after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction">West German terrorist gang</a>, the origin story is from 1994 when <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2007/02/23/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-or-the-joy-of-juxtaposition-responsorial-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23/">an online commenter wrote</a>: "an incident in which I was talking to a friend about the Baader-Meinhof gang (and this was many years after they were in the news). The next day, my friend phoned me and referred me to an article in that dayâ€™s newspaper in which the Baader-Meinhof gang was mentioned. Quel surpris!"

        I think there are connections here to the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">Memetics</a> and how ideas transmit through society.
