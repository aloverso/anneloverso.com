I often say "Dungeons & Dragons" because it's the most well-known RPG, but in reality, I play quite a few other systems as well and really enjoy the intricacies of how each system of rules creates different playing experiences.  Others that I currently enjoy include Powered by the Apocalypse games like Dungeon World, Masks, and Monster of the Week.

More coming soon...
