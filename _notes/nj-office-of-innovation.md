I joined the [@NJGov](https://twitter.com/NJGov) [Office of Innovation](https://innovation.nj.gov/) in February 2021.

My role is to serve New Jerseyans as part of a small but influential technical engineering team. We apply human-centered design and [[Agile]] methodologies to create products and services that are more effective, more efficient, and more impactful for the people of New Jersey. We also effect change as a model for modern, digital technology practices in government and public interest. 

Currently, I work with the Business First Stop team, creating a business-centric digital dashboard for prospective small-business owners to simplify and demystify the process for starting a business in New Jersey.
