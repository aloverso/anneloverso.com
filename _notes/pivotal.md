I worked at Pivotal Labs (bought by VMware in 2020, now called VMware Pivotal Labs) from August 2017 - January 2021.
[Pivotal Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs) is a software consultancy focused on [[Agile]] and [[Extreme Programming|XP]] 
digital transformations for our clients.  For me, consulting is about knowing when to be teaching and when to be listening.

## Experience

Engineering leader of teams of up to 10 software engineers, onboarding new members, mentoring others, 
facilitating decision-making, and representing the team needs to stakeholders.

Designed and built greenfield applications and REST APIs, and worked in legacy codebases,
in React, Java, Node, Kotlin, Angular, Python, and Vue.js.

Trained and taught client developers in [[Extreme Programming]] (XP) principles and practices, 
including [[pair programming]], [[test-driven development]] (TDD), and Lean UX practices. 
Pair programmed 8 hours / day. Wrote unit, integration, contract, & end-to-end automated test suites.

Supported product managers maintaining a backlog, and supported designers through user research and product ideation, 
providing a technical lens and feasibility voice to decision-making. Expert at communicating technical ideas to 
non-technical collaborators. Skilled consultant in stakeholder management, facilitation, cross-functional communication.

Created and managed CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, Gitlab, TeamCity, and Concourse that
enable [[Agile]] teams to confidently release quality software to production.

Mentored client engineers to be [[Extreme Programming|XP]] evangelists in their own companies. Led workshops to 
30+ engineers teaching SOLID principles. Mentored and coached senior client engineers.
