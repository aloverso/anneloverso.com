The **vertical slice** is a technique for an [[Agile]] pattern of building software.

If we imagine the completed app as a whole cake, how can we incrementally provide value to the user when the cake is not fully completed yet?

The **non-vertical slice** approach{% Foot num:"1" %} would incrementally build up supporting layers.



{% FootnoteContainer %}
    {% Footnote num:"1" %}
        Sometimes known as "horizontal slice", but that's a reductive attempt at opposite-ism, I think.
