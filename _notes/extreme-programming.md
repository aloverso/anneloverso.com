# XP Values

### Communication
We care about dynamic, fast, synchronous communication.

### Simplicity
It’s easy to build a complex mess of software. It’s hard to build simple software.

### Feedback
Sofware is best built through a process of learning, not up-front planning.  Feedback enables us to know what works and what doesn't, and allows us to use those learnings to adjust future action.

### Courage
It takes courage to do the right thing, to choose the hard thing over the easy thing, to tell stakeholders difficult truth, to take calculated risks, to ship a Lean yet unfinished slice of your code to production.

### Respect
We need to respect each other to give and receive effective feedback, to communicate kindly, and to collaborate fully.
