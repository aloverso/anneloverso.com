My partner and I bought a mini skoolie bus and we are working together to convert it into a mobile home.

You can follow our progress at our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/googlyeyedskoolie).

In the meantime, here's some pure-CSS art I made of our bus. It's hidden on mobile because I'm [new to CSS art](https://twitter.com/AnneLoVerso/status/1256329874534367232) so it will otherwise make the page look terrible on mobile.

<div class="pvxl hide-on-mobile">
    {% include bus.html %}
</div>

<style>
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
        .hide-on-mobile {
            display: none;
        }
    }
</style>
