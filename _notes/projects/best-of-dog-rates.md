The **dog_rates2020** app is something I made for two purposes:
- put together a bunch of UI/full-stack app patterns into one reference codebase
- make something fun

Thus, we end up with **dog_rates2020**, which pulls all of the tweets made by the [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account and displays them side-by-side in a voting bracket style so that users can vote for the Best Dog of 2020.
