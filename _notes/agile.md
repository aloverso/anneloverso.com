To remind myself of what it really means, I often review the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan
