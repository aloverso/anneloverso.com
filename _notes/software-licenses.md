title: Esoteric Software Licenses (and anti-licenses)

I have a burgeoning fascination with esoteric software licensing. Why? It's mostly unenforceable anyways, it's truly interesting to see how people attempt to control (or, not control) the way in which people use their open-source software... and therefore, try to control their own impact on the world.

Note (for employers and similar): I do not advocate any of the positions, worldviews, nor curse words contained on this page. Merely cataloguing them for my own interests.

## My list of licenses (with excerpts)
