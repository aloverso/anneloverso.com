I graduated [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu/) in 2017 with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Engineering with a self-defined concentration in Computing and a GPA of 3.92.

What does that silly degree title mean?  It means I majored in generalized engineering - for me, a synthesis of design thinking, systems analysis, and engineering modeling classes - and I specialized in computing - that is, specifically software not hardware.

I also minored in teaching & education, and spent a lot of time at school thinking about systems of education and how they could be better, and doing formal research on what it means to train teachers.

## About Olin College

Olin is a small, new engineering college located outside of Boston.

**Small** - My graduating class was 87 students

**New** - Olin's first graduating class was in 2006.

## Core learnings

These are the principles from Olin that I still talk about and apply regularly.
