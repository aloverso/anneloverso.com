# www.anneloverso.com

This is the source code for [anneloverso.com](http://anneloverso.com/) - my personal website, digital garden, and little corner of the internet.

It's a static site created in Jekyll and deployed on Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4f604e93-85b2-42d4-ae3e-8e113df4ba40/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gracious-williams-ccb54f/deploys)

## Attributions

This site was bootstrapped from [digital-garden-jekyll-template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

It uses [jekyll-spark](https://github.com/helpscout/jekyll-spark) to handle some reusable components.

Footnotes are created using a modified version of [Kaushik Gopal's scripting method](https://blog.jkl.gg/jekyll-footnote-tufte-sidenote/).

I generate box shadows with [Philipp Brumm's webapp](https://brumm.af/shadows).
