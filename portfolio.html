					<div class="span8">
						<p>This spring, 2015, I am in the process of taking a semester off from Olin to work in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil at a school called Insper.  Insper was originally a business school, but they have been working to create a new engineering program in partnership with Olin College.  This gave me the opportunity to travel here for the spring, along with four other Olin students, to work to help develop the classes and curriculum as they launch the brand new engineering school.</p>

						<p>This semester begins the first class of students to attend the school.  Our projects are exciting and varied, and many still in progress (as of writing this, I'm halfway through the semester here).  Our first few weeks revolved around coordinating admissions for the students, and running the design challenge for their Candidate's Day.  Then, we planned activities for the first week orientation activities.  Now that classes have begun, one of our primary roles is to act as course assistants, assisting in classes and hold office hours to help students and get feedback on how the classes are running.</p>

						<p>Other projects include assisting students with creating clubs and giving program feedback, doing research on student motivation in their courses, coordinating activities between Olin and Insper, and designing future courses.  Currently, I am working on a mini-workshop for students to learn to use an Intel Galileo for Arduino and Python projects (<a href="blog.html#CompleteIntelGalileoAdaptedSet-UpforWindows">see the blog post I wrote about it</a>).  Later on, I'll be designing and prototyping a class for the computer science students based on <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">this book</a> that starts at basic principles of logic gates and works up, step-by-step, to constructing a processor and making a Tetris game.</p>

				<h2>Piano-Playing Robot</h2>
				<h4>An 8-week project to integrate electrical, mechanical, and software components</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span8">
						<p>Working with five other students for eight weeks, we built a piano-playing robot that could play three octaves of notes (including black keys).  It could read music digitally from a MIDI file as well as using computer vision to read a PDF or image file of sheet music.</p>
						<p>My role on the team was primarily working on the Optical Music Recognition algorithms, although we all worked together on the fabrication and assembly of the electrical and mechanical components.  For this project, I learned <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>, a powerful computer vision package for Python and other languages.</p>
						<p>The Optical Music Recognition (OMR) was one of the most exciting and most challenging projects I have ever worked on.  A breif overview is as follows, but for a full description of the process, please visit the <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/poe2014/pianobot/software.html">software page on our website</a>.
						<ol>
							<li>Convert a PDF of the sheet music into a PNG image file</li>
							<li>Search through the entire image and use the HoughLines algorithm to find and save the y-location of every staff line within the image.</li>
							<li>Split the image into several images, each representing a single line of music, and remove staff lines</li>
							<li>Use a connectivity search to traverse a line of music column by column, checking if it contains any black pixels, and group those columns together as note objects</li>
							<li>Split each note object image in half along the horizontal line, to separate the treble clef staff from the bass clef staff.</li>
							<li>Use a mean-shift algorithm to locates the center of mass of black pixels in the image, which we consider to be the center of the note</li>
							<li>Distinguish between half and quarter notes by checking if the center is black or white, and checks for the existence of a stem to distinguish between whole and half notes. Detects more than one note in the image (in a group of eighth notes), and breaks them apart.</li>
							<li>Compare the location of the center to the locations of the staff lines, and identify which line or space corresponds to the note's vertical position to obtain note name.</li>
						</ol>
						</p>
						<p>The full code is available at our <a href="https://github.com/sarahwalters/piano-poe">Github repo</a>, and a full description of the project and all its systems is available on our <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/poe2014/pianobot/">website</a>.  The videos to the right show the PianoBot playing <i>Fur Elise</i> reading from MIDI file and <i>Ode to Joy</i> reading from OMR.  The OMR is imperfect, as exemplified in a few conspicuously wrong notes, but we are extremely pleased with the result from eight weeks of work.</p>

				<h2>Applied Computational Robotics</h2>
				<h4>Using hacked Neato robotic vacuum cleaners</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span8">
						<p>For my final project in Computational Robotics, two other students and I worked together to created what we called the "Neato Carnival" - a obstacle course that a Neato robot could navigate autonomously.  We used the robot's onboard Lidar scanners in combination with video camera "seeing" to get sensory input from the environment, analyzed them in python, and controlled the robot's motor motion via ROS to respond.</p>
						<p>The project worked such that the Neato could be placed anywhere in the "world".  It would look for an obstacle, approach it, and idenify what the obstacle was, through the use of fiducials.  Then, it would use a finite-state controller to switch into completing the steps for that obstacle, and when it was done it would go back to looking for obstacles again.  We had three obstacles in the world.  The first was a tunnel that the Neato had to navigate through without bumping into the walls.  It relied solely on Lidar data, because in reality, tunnels are dark and it wouldn't get feedback from the video input.  In the dominoes obstacle, it had to move carefully to knock over red dominoes without harming blue dominoes.  We used computer vision (the OpenCV package for python) to process camera input and identify domino colors. It also had to cross a bridge without falling off, again using computer vision to stay between two pink lines.</p>
						<p>The project was a deep dive into concepts like finite-state machines and computer vision, and we learned a lot in those areas, as well as using third-party ROS packages and implementing within those packages.  The video to the right shows the robot successfully navigating the tunnel, locating the next obstacle (Dominoes), and lining up to complete Dominoes.  <a href="https://github.com/hmurraydavis/neato_carnival">View our Github repository</a> to see all the code we wrote, as well as an in-depth write-up and reflection of the project and its components, or <a href="img/comprobo_poster.png">view our poster</a> for an overview of the systems and the structure.</p>

				<h2>A Dive into Curricular Design</h2>
				<h4>How can I get fourth graders excited about math?</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span4">
						<a href="img/mathcurriculum.png"><img src="img/mathcurriculum.png" alt="Poster of math curriculum design"></a>
					</div>
					<div class="span8">
						<p>In the Fall 2014 semester, another student and I volunteered to teach a before-school math program for fourth-grade students at a local school.  One day per week, we came in and had an hour to teach math.  As it was an opt-in extracurricular program for the kids, we had free reign to teach what we wanted, with the total support of the coordinators.  So my co-teacher and I worked hard to put together a curriculum that tied together, and taught unique, interesting concepts that were fun and hands-on.</p>

						<p>We started out by developing a set of values as educators that would drive our lesson plans:
						<ul>
							<li>Encouraging informal peer teaching between students to share and gain knowledge</li>
							<li>Designing hands-on activities that keep students engaged</li>
							<li>Be aware of each student's individual learning habits and how to best teach for them</li>
							<li>Leaving time for one-on-one check-ins and individual exploration</li></ul></p>

						<p>With these in mind, and inpsired by our own coursework in Discrete Mathematics, we chose to start our first lesson with the concept of infinity and work from there.  Lessons naturally flowed into place as we moved from infinity to fractals, and from there to sequences, tied together by a dive into the Fibonacci sequence.  We finished by talking about functions and defining sequences in functional notation.  The full list:
						<ol>
							<li>Infinity - Hilbert's Hotel</li>
							<li>Fractals - Irregular and Sierpinski Triangle</li>
							<li>Fractal sequences</li>
							<li>Sequences - arithmetic, geomtric, word, Fibonacci</li>
							<li>Fibonacci - spirals on plants, the Golden Ratio, flower spirals</li>
							<li>Complex Numbers? - Functions</li>
							<li>Ordered pairs, formulas from recursive definitions</li>
							<li>Dragon fractal - structure behind the fractal</li>
						</ol></p>

						<p>We had an awesome time teaching the classes, and we think the kids did too.  Hands-on lessons like the Fibonacci lesson were a huge hit.  We brought in pineapples and artichokes and pinecones to have them find Fibonacci spiral patterns in nature, and then had them interact with a python script I wrote to see why plants grew that way and how the number phi fit into it all.  We also made some mistakes, and some lessons didn't go so well.  For example, in Lesson 6, we had planned to introduce complex numbers, with the hope of showing them how fractals like the Mandelbrot Set are created.  But we quickly realized we had assumed they knew more than they did, like the coordinate plane.  We switched gears halfway through to teaching the coordinate plane and functions.  But overall, the kids loved learning and it was so rewarding to see them go off to tell their teachers and parents about the Mandelbrot Set or the Sierpinski triangle.  One girl went home and showed her parents why Fibonacci spirals exist on pinecones.  Hearing those stories felt great.</p>

				<h2>My Red Hat Summer Internship</h2>
				<h4>Or, the story of how I became an Open Source activist</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span8">
						<p>In the summer of 2014, I worked as a Systems Management Intern at <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>.  My role was on <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io">Project Atomic</a>, a lightweight OS that performs atomic upgrades and rollbacks, designed to run Docker containers.  My summer work focued on OSTree and rpm-ostree, the programs that allow deploying a new version of your OS alongside the current one and navigating between them.  Specifically, I made these programs and their command-line interface easier to use by sysadmins.  For a more detailed description of my various projects, <a href="reveal/expo_pres.html">check out this short presentation.</a></p>

						<p>My experience at Red Hat was a wholly positive one.  I learned so much about open source culture, Linux development, C programming, and Unix navigation and tools.  Not only that, but my first corporate experience gave me a lot of insight into teamwork, scrum meetings, working to follow established coding guidelines, working within a larger project, and the support structure of a sprint team that you don't get as much exposure to in school.  Overall, it was a great experience, and you can read more about what it felt like to be working in the Red Hat environment in <a href="https://opensource.com/life/14/7/red-hat-intern-sys-admin">this article I wrote about my internship published on opensource.com</a></p>

					<div class="span8">
						<p>For a the final project for a first-year, second-semester sensors and measurements class, three other students and I worked together to build an infrared 3D scanner.  We were inspired by a lab we had done on ultrasonic range finders, and wanted to use that technology to make a device that could build a 3D image of an object.</p>

					 	<p>We used an Arduino to control an infrared sensor, which took data at each step to calculate the distance to the object. The data were processed in MATLAB, and we used the 3D plotting function to create a virtual image of the solid object. We then were able to take those data points and reconstruct them into a solid surface in SolidWorks, and 3D print the virtual scan of the object.</p>

						<p>Overall, the project was a lot of fun.  It was a great teamwork experience as well as a learning opportunity to gain more knowledge of circuits, MatLab, mechanical design, and data analysis.  Another teammate and I were proud enough of the project to present it at an adult science fair at <a href="http://artisansasylum.com">Artisan's Asylum</a> in Somerville, MA.</p>

				<h2>FrisbE: the Engineering Education App for Kids</h2>
				<h4>It stands for "Fostering Real Innovation in Students Beginning Engineering"</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span8">
						<p>For the final project for my Python Software Design class, my team and I worked together to create an app that could teach kids in the age range of 8-11 about engineering in a fun, interactive way.  We created an app with four minigames that each focused on a separate engineering skill.  Unlike most apps on the market, which teach "science" or "physics", we wanted to focus on engineering concepts, so our four minigames taught:
						<ul>
							<li>Computational logic</li>
							<li>Critical thinking in the context of population dynamics</li>
							<li>Diagnosis in mechanical systems</li>
							<li>Creative exploration into materials science</li>
						</ul></p>

						<p>The project was a team effort, and each of us adopted a minigame to focus on.  I built the computational logic game ("Robowrangler"), which involved a player navigating a robot through an obstacle course by building a "script" of commands and watching as the robot responded to each command in real time.  The goal was to show that computers think differently from humans and need specific commands in order to navigate simple tasks.  It also had video-game components such as collecting money to buy power-ups for your robot.</p>

						<p>I do research two credits per semester on Engineering Education with Professor Yevgeniya Zastavker.  My interest in education, especially in engineering, has only been fueled by my time at Olin and my time on this research team.</p>

						<p>My team of four students has been working on researching what causes students to go into teaching careers later in life.  This is based off the statistic that Olin students are entering teaching careers at almost twice that national average.</p>
						
						<p>We collected survey data for a case study at Olin from over 200 current students and alumni, and spent the spring semester of 2014 analyzing that data.  We applied for an NSF Grant to conduct interviews with selected subjects, and our research paper on that first round of data was accepted for the <a href="http://fie2014.org/">Frontiers in Education 2014 conference</a> in Madrid.  Overall, it's been an amazing, educational experience.</p>

I was on a subteam that would esnure the efficiency of the bike design by measuring the power output of each biker and the power loss due to friction and other sinks.</p>

						<p>With two other students, we acquired a $1700 treadmill free off Craigslist, deconstructed it in an apartment attic, and carried the pieces down a fire escape and back to school.  We planned to use the bike wheels to turn the rollers, generating a voltage in the treadmill motor.  We would then measure that voltage and convert it to a power output.  Sounds easy, but it involved numerous calculations, and building a voltage divider that would reduce the frankly dangerous voltage levels coming from the motor, which included buying an enormous ceramic resistor.  I learned a lot from this project on both mechanical structure as well as electrical circuit construction, and improved my skills in both areas.</p>

						<p>For a Modeling and Simulation class final project, my partner and I studied weather balloons rising into the atmosphere. Weather balloons are unique because they are made of flexible latex that can expand. We examined how the radius of the balloon expands with increasing altitude and decreasing air pressure, which affect the buoyancy and drag forces on the balloon. We then examined how the initial balloon radius affects how many balloons it takes to lift different load masses, and compared it to party balloons. We found that weather balloons, because of the changing radius, take far fewer balloons to lift the same mass.</p>

						<p>Twenty states currently have laws which prohibit leaving children unattended in vehicles. Since 1998, 604 children have suffered heat-related deaths in cars. My partner and I examined the system of the enclosed vehicle. We abstracted the thermal flows into equations based on blackbody radiation and conduction, and implemented them in MATLAB. Our model demonstrated that the darker the dashboard color, the sooner the air temperature in the car reaches 50°C. However, the color of the dashboard is less important on hotter days.</p>

				<h2>Oscillating Electromagnets Circuit</h2>
				<h4>"At least the oscillations worked"</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span8">
						<p>My partner and I intended to design and build a system that used electromagnets to keep a metal ball centered on an oscillating ramp. It used a hysteretic oscillator to tilt up and down a lego bar attached in the center to a motor. The intent was to place a metal ball in the track of this bar and, using electromagnets placed at either end of the bar, keep the ball centered desipite the motor's oscillations. The electromagnets would do this by turning on and off in opposition with the tilt of the bar. The circuitry ended up successful but the practicality of the magnets on the ramp prevented us from fully achieving our goal. It was a complex circuit design challenge to cause the electromagnets to oscillate in opposition, that we eventually solved using transistors.</p>
