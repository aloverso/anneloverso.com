"About Damn Time"
A death knell sounds
No matter where I go
Cities or small towns
All I want is something to call my own
But I'm in the dark now
We set out confidently
But what if we are wrong
We shound have been there long ago
Shouldn't take this long
We stumbled accidentally
To a place unknown
It's about damn time we swallow the pain
Before it spreads
The memories we don't wanna know
I still wake up with the same song
And it's
Stuck in my head
The melody always takes me home
Take me home
(Take me home)
I'm standing now waiting with both eyes closed
Whatever's next
A fist smashing down
Black eyes or broken bones
Maybe a soft kiss
I'm tired of always guessing
Whether the sky will fall
Each time I learn my lesson
I forget it all
The time we spent preparing
We always miss it all
It's about damn time we swallow the pain
Before it spreads
The memories we don't wanna know
I still wake up with the same song
And it's
Stuck in my head
The melody always takes me home
Take me home
To save a broken branch
We cut them in half
She said "I wish I could help you"
I said "You already have"
It's about damn time we swallow the pain
Before it spreads
The memories we don't wanna know
I still wake up with the same song
And it's
Stuck in my head
The melody always takes me home
Take me home, take me home
