## This site is for us both

This site is a work-in-progress. There will be incomplete pages. 

It's intended to be a growing, living document of my work and experiences, and by that nature, will always have tendrils of new ideas in the form of unfinished pages that I want to expand.

By that nature, it's for both of us. For me, to document, expand, explore, reflect, and self-connect. For you, to visit, observe, connect, and expand. I write things. You [let me know what you think](https://twitter.com/anneloverso).

It's [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/aloverso/anneloverso.com) with attributions to the tools I used to build it.
